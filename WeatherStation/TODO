Go through all of the files and whatnot that I created, I added a ton of stuff. Just familiarize yourself with it so it makes sense. 

Get Data- Temp, Barometric pressure, etc. All of these functions just need to tell the IC to start sampling data, and then recieve the data and convert it to real data(not adc values)

 
-We should possibly add some cool features, possibly create some interface for recieving the data to do math on.
	--Python has a good way to recieve Serial Data(UART).
	

SPI For Temp:
		Communications start with bringing Chip select low. - Should be high until ready to transmit
		--Data will begin to transmit. - First bit
		----We have to wait until 14 bits of data are transferred
			----Bring CS back high
		
Receiving Data
	--ADC
	---Write to buffer
