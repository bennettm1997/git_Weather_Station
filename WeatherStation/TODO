Go through all of the files and whatnot that I created, I added a ton of stuff. Just familiarize yourself with it so it makes sense. 
Logging- we need a module that will take all the the returned data from all the function calls and send it over bluetooth as a packet. This should be easy, I already setup the framework.
Get Data- Temp, Barometric pressure, etc. All of these functions just need to tell the IC to start sampling data, and then recieve the data and convert it to real data(not adc values)
The Get_All_Data function just calls the other get functions at the proper intervals
We need an int to string function - google ITOA, this is what we will send over bluetooth. This will be much easier, so we do not just have a bunch of confusing raw data being sent over bluetooth.
The project doesnt have that much work to do. 
-We should possibly add some cool features, possibly create some interface for recieving the data to do math on.
	--Python has a good way to recieve Serial Data(UART).
-We need something that handles all of the logging.
	--Data vs logging. The IC data(temp, pressure etc) will get overrun, as in we will be logging a lot more than actually transmitting data. 
		---This is why I added a "*" or "?", so we can write a quick script that will differentiate the types of serial data.
